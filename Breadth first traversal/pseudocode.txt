Pseudocode for the implementation

1. Create a tree using dictionary having key with multiple values
2. Create an empty queue and visited list
3. Initialize the root node to a variable as
        Current_node = root
3. Traverse the tree and then append the Current_node in queue
4. loop:
        	4.1 Append the visited node  in the visited list
          	4.2  for each element  in keys
                             4.2.1  test (current node == element ) && tree[elem]  ! = none
	                                  4.2.1.1  for each  value in (length of tree’s element )
                                                    Append in queue  the traversed element
            	4.3   Pop queue’s 1st element
                4.4 	test if (queue’s length ==0)
        	                            break
                            else
                                  	Current_node = queue[0]
           	Print visited nodes
